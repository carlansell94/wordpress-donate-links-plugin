A block-based WordPress plugin to add donate links to your post/page.

Adds a new block named 'Donate Links', which can be inserted anywhere in a page. Ideally, this block is designed to be shown in a site sidebar.

Note that this is still in active development, and therefore the current feature-set is limited.

# How To Use
Download the .zip file from releases, and install it through the WordPress 'Upload Plugin' feature. If you want to clone the repository, you'll need to build the extension before it will run.

The release tagged 'latest' is considered the current version, with a second release (labelled pre-release) reflecting the latest state of the repository. Builds are automated on each commit.

Open the customiser, and edit one of your widget areas (preferably a sidebar). Add the 'Donate Links' block, and add the desired links.

# Supported Link Types
Currently includes style support for the following link types:
* Buy Me a Coffee
* Ko-Fi
* Patreon
* PayPal

Note that this impacts the link style only - it's possible to add any link user each link type.

# Future Development
The following features are planned for future versions of the plugin:
* Option to add custom styling to each link
* Option to add additional link types (and associated styles) in the plugin settings
* Option to customise the background colour of the block
* Option to display site icons inside each link button
* Validation/limitations on link type values to ensure URLs are valid
